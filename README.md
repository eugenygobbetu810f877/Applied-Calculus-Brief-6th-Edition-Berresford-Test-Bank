  * This text uses intriguing real-world applications to engage readers' interest and show them the practical side of calculus. The book's many applications are related to finance, business, and such general-interest topics as learning curves in airplane production, the age of the Dead Sea Scrolls, Apple and Oracle stock prices, the distance traveled by sports cars, lives saved by seat belts, and the cost of a congressional victory. The Sixth Edition maintains the hallmark features that have made APPLIED CALCULUS, BRIEF so popular: contemporary and interesting applications; careful and effective use of technology, including graphing calculator and spreadsheet coverage; constant pedagogical reinforcement through section summaries, chapter summaries, annotated examples, and extra practice problems; Just-in-Time algebra review material; and a variety of exercises that allow readers to practice and hone their problem-solving skills.
